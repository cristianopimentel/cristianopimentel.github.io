<p>Hi, I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a passion for <strong>building great relationship with customers</strong>. 
   I believe <strong>trust is the ultimate feedback</strong> you can receive from customers and your team.</p>

<p>Currently I lead a Java and .Net team and "get hand dirty" whenever I can.</p>
