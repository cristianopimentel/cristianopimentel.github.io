Back in 2017 the company I work for decided to do more Agile projects. I hever ever had worked with it before... ok... maybe some XP Programming? Go Horse? (lol)

The team got together, created some sort of discussion forum and started studying. I set a goal that I would come back from my vacations as a certified Scrum Master, my 1st ever certification.

I started researching, reading 1 month before my vacation period (20 days), than during this period I started reading more and more (more time available). And then I went to war and took the test. Nailed it! =)

Here is the list of all the things I found, read and saved for further access.
