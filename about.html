<p>Hi, I'm an experienced Software Engineer with a passion for <strong>building great relationship with customers</strong>. 
    I believe <strong>trust is the ultimate feedback</strong> you can receive from customers and your team.</p>
 
<p>Currently I release the cleanest and simplest solution that bring the most value to customer. How do I do that? Well, I coach the team I lead into KISS and DRY principles, I get "hand dirty" when needed, I learn, I make mistakes and learn with them. And oh, I listen. I listen the customers and the team. A lot.</p>

<p>I'm also a human of 2 cats and 2 dogs, and a beloved husband!</p>

<p>This is what I've been up to:
    <ul>
        <li>building this site! My ideas and to-do's go <a href="https://trello.com/b/l7ww5vC7" target="_blank">here</a></li>
        <li>finding opportunities to use my recently studying result: I'm now a <a href="https://www.scrum.org/user/275492" target="_blank">Professional Scrum Master</a> now \o/</li>
        <li>keeping up with my <a href="https://trello.com/b/8M1UFnoE" target="_blank">Learning Path</a></li>
        <li>trying to master the <a href="https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique" target="_blank">Pomodoro Technique</a> for Focus =)</li>
        <li>planning and executing the Big Plan
        <i class="fa fa-plane"></i><i class="fa fa-globe"></i><i class="fa fa-home"></i>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>What about checking my <a href="/projects">projects</a> and <a href="/resume">resume</a> and... <a href="/contact">hiring me</a>?</p>
